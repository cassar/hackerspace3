# GovHack - Hackerspace

A system to manage competition participants, sponsors, and management.

## Framework

Hackerspace 3 is a [Ruby on Rails application](https://rubyonrails.org/)

Current major version is 6

Check out the [Rails Guides](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/index.html) to get up and running.

## Ruby version

- `2.6.3`

## Database initialization and creation

[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) is required.

```bash
$ rails db:setup
```

*This will load the seeds also, see db/seeds.rb for more options*

## Test Suite

Current coverage is unit tests for models, controllers, and services.

```bash
$ rails test
```

## Services

hackerspace3 makes use of AWS and Google services.

See the below Environment Variables Required to enable specific services.

## Deployment instructions

```bash
$ rails server
```

## Docker Deployment Instructions

Initialise environment variables required by `docker-compose`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

**IMPORTANT**: Then edit `.env` with a text editor and choose a more secure password for the `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` variable.

If you don't want to wait for the Docker image to build from your local copy of the repo, start with:

```bash
docker pull govhackau/hackerspace3
```

(If you don't do the above, the image will get automatically built; this should take about 10 minutes on a modern machine.)

Run Hackerspace:

**NOTE**: The initial run of Hackerspace will likely take several minutes to initialise the database before being usable. This is normal.

```bash
$ docker-compose up
```

Then browse to http://localhost:3000 and click Sign In.

* Username: `admin@hackerspace.com`
* Password: `password`

(Note, refer to `db/seeders/seeder.rb` and `db/seeders/user_seeder.rb` to see where these are set)

To stop Hackerspace:

```bash
$ docker-compose down
```

Or, to stop and remove the Hackerspace database:

**NOTE:** If you do this, you'll need to re-run the "Initialise the postgres database" instructions above, the next time you want to use Hackerspace. Only do this if you want to start with a fresh database, or completely remove the Hackerspace project from Docker.

```bash
$ docker-compose down -v
```

To explicitly rebuild a new `hackerspace3` Docker image from your local code:

```bash
docker build -t govhackau/hackerspace3 .
```

Or, to build the image *and* start the container as usual, run:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

To actively make local changes to your codebase without needing to rebuild the image, start the database image with:

```bash
docker-compose up -d postgres
```

Then start the `govhackau/hackerspace3` image with:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/usr/src/app --service-ports hackerspace3
```

NOTE: Due to the "$(pwd)" in the above command, it should work in any POSIX shell (bash/sh/zsh etc), and PowerShell. It won't work in Windows Command Prompt.

This runs the container and bind-mounts your checked out code into the container so you can work on it without needing to rebuild the container's image.
